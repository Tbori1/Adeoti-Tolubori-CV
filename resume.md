I am a highly analytical person with a keen interest in data analytics and data science. I studied Industial Chemistry at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. However my recent works have drawn me towards data analytics, I now enjoy this more than laboratory bench work. 
I have worked in the manufacturing sector; collecting data, interpreting quality trends and detecting anomaly in products from data generated during quantitative and qualitative tests. I have used different analytic tools such as excel,SQL, power bi, tableau and data modelling using machine learning. I am passionate about improving  performance and helping organaizations make informed decisions through data analytics.
